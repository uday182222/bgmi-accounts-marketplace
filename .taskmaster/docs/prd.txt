Product Requirements Document (PRD) - BGMI ID Marketplace

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:** Create a secure, admin-mediated marketplace for buying and selling BGMI accounts, ensuring safe transactions, credential handling, and optional buyer/seller protection.

**Target Users:**

* Sellers: Anyone who wants to sell their BGMI accounts.
* Buyers: Users who want to purchase verified BGMI accounts.
* Admins: Platform managers who mediate transactions and ensure safety.

**Key Principle:** The platform acts as a dealer (like Cashify), not peer-to-peer. Sellers submit to admin; buyers purchase verified IDs.

---

## 2. Authentication

**Features:**

* AWS Cognito authentication.
* Multi-auth support:

  * Email + Password
  * Google Sign-In (OAuth2.0 federated login)

**Notes:**

* Separate from BGMI credentials submitted for sale.
* Admin accounts have role-based access.

## 3. Seller Flow

1. **Listing Submission**

   * Upload **profile screenshot** + **5–6 inventory screenshots**.
   * Fill in **IGN, BGMI ID, title, description (optional)**.
   * Preview of the post.
   * Submit → goes to **Admin Portal only**.

2. **Negotiation**

   * Seller provides an **offer/asking price**.
   * Admin can **accept, counter, or reject**.
   * Credentials are submitted only **after negotiation is finalized**.

3. **Credential Submission**

   * Secure form: **login method (Facebook/Twitter only, no 2FA)** + password.
   * Additional instructions optional.

## 4. Admin Flow

1. **Listing Review**

   * Admin receives submitted listings.
   * Checks screenshots, description, offer.

2. **Negotiation**

3. **Credential Handling & Safe Period**

   * Safe period timer (default 1–2 days, adjustable).
   * Credentials encrypted and stored securely.

4. **Payout**

   * Instant release **after successful safe test**.
   * If login fails, return account to seller without changes.
